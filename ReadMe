I have incorporated the code for all the different aspects as mentioned in the assignemnt.

The only portion I couldnt succesfully resolve was the Cookie pop-up, but I feel I could have figured it out, outside of the given time constraints.

Automation7.py contains the final code for the assignemnt.
Automation5.py contains all the different code blocks I used to complete the different steps of the assignment. (The commented code blocks are the ones that could potentially work, but didnt)

The reason I am attaching both files is so that my methods/algortihms/general thought process could be shared.

Thank you for the opportunity of completing this assignment.

Hope to hear back from you soon. Thank you.
